This manual provides a reference for SuperBASIC, a beginner-friendly programming language for the Foenix F256 series of personal computers. It is not a tutorial and assumes the reader has some prior knowledge of programming in general and of BASIC in particular.\\

SuperBASIC builds upon the heritage of classic BASIC dialects while introducing a wide range of enhancements that make programming even more fun and accessible. It is tightly integrated with the advanced hardware capabilities of the F256 platform, offering first-class access to graphics, sprites, game controllers, sound, and more. Notable language additions include structured control flow, named subroutines, inline assembly, and an enriched standard library. \\

Weâ€™ve worked hard to make SuperBASIC a powerful and approachable language for curious minds of all ages. We hope you enjoy using it as much as we enjoyed creating it!
