\chapter{Sound}

\section{Introduction}

Depending on the hardware model and generation, an F256 machine includes a stereo SN76489 sound chip, and may also feature additional audio hardware such as SID, OPL3, and MIDI chips.\\

In SuperBASIC, sound output uses only the SN76489 chip, with the same tones played simultaneously on both the left and right channels.

\section{Channels}

There are four sound channels, numbered 0 to 3. 0 to 2 are simple square wave channels, the 3rd is a sound channel.\\

Sounds have a queue of sounds to play. So you could queue up a series of notes to play and they will carry on playing one after the other (if they are on the same channel).\\

SuperBASIC does not stop to play the sounds; it is processed in the background. Everything can be silenced with SOUND OFF.\\

It is possible to set a parameter to automatically change the pitch of the channel as it plays to allow easy creation of simple warpy sound effects.

\section{Easy commands}

Four commands ZAP, SHOOT, PING, and EXPLODE exist, which play a simple sound effect.
